# MySpellbook

As a regular player of table-top role-playing games, I know first hand how difficult managing ones spells can be. This app attemps to aleviate some of the difficulty of keeping track of the spells in a player character's spellbook.

### Getting Started

The app is deployed on Heroku [here](https://my-dnd-spellbook.herokuapp.com/). Once you are at the website, you may log in or register your email and password as a new user. You may then begin to customize your spellbook by adding spells. Each spell is clickable which will take you to it details page where you can see helpful information which can assist you while you play your character. Also from the details page, you can edit that spell to suit your campaign's needs. If, for whatever reason, you need to remove the spell from your spell book, you may do so from the spells detail page as well.
